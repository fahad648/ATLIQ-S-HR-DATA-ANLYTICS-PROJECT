Thrilled to share my latest project where I delved into HR analytics for an Indian company, analyzing three months of employee attendance data (April, May, June). This journey involved transforming raw data into actionable insights, and the results were eye-opening!

🔍 Key Insights Uncovered:

Work Preferences: Analyzed the balance between office and work-from-home preferences.

Absence Trends: Identified the most common days for absences, sick leaves, and remote work.
📊 Metrics Developed:

The purpose of choosing and doing this project was to get acquainted with the HR world, enhance my data cleaning skills, and work with a real dataset. Additionally, I’m currently learning Power BI dashboarding to visualize these insights effectively. While I’m still honing my skills, I'm excited about the progress and eager to become proficient soon!

This project has been a rewarding experience, showcasing the power of data in enhancing HR strategies and understanding employee behaviors.

Excited to leverage these insights for better workforce management and continue exploring the dynamic field of HR analytics!
